<h1>Fungo Golf</h1><br>
<h2>The old pitchers past time</h2><br>
<p>Growing up this was a game that me and all of my buddies played when ever we had the chance. It's really unique mix up of both golf and baseball! You play just like you would play golf except on a baseball field, and you use Fungo Bats and baseballs! Imagine all around the field you have holes or targets that you have to hit in order to complete that shot for the round. Some example I can give you would be a water cooler in the dugout or a sign on the outfield fence. The players have to tee off in this game by throwing the ball up to themselves and hitting. From this point where ever the ball lands the player has to putt just you would in golf to make the shot. There are some other variation on how to putt but for now thats the way we have it in the game. Currently this version of the game is available in the google play store <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.acazo.fungo">Click here to download</a></p>

<h1>Fungo Golf 3D</h1>
<p>The first game was cool and all but not even close to where I see it going. We have completely revamped all of the graphics in the game. We have updated all of the characters to 3D models, added a new main menu screen, new locker room, all new gear and power ups for a customization feature, and also added some new fields. The game is set to release in a couple of months on both IOS and android devices! Here are a few screen shots, dont wanna show to much, I'd rather it be a suprise!</p>
