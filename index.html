		<h1>Who is James Young?</h1>
			<p>Let see where do I start? I'm from a small city in New Jersey, called Bayonne. I've attended William Paterson University, majoring in Business management. During my tenure there, I was also a 4 year student athlete, where I was a pitcher on the baseball team. Before graduating, I came up with a really cool idea for a new mobile app, and over the last year and a half I've led a team of developers and designers to launch Fungo Golf into the Google Play store. Since rolling out that game, we have been working non stop on updating and really taking this game to the next level. Take a look at it, download it, and give me some feed back I'd really appreciate it!</p>

			<p>After school, I had a tough time trying to find a job, so I had two part time gigs, while continuing to build this game week by week. Mostly all of the money I made would go stright to a new feature or character, etc. As time went by, I tried to teach my self how to code, which wasn't an easy task. So I did some research and found DBC, now I'm here trying to learn as much as possible, make some great connections, and really hit the ground running after graduation!</p></div>
